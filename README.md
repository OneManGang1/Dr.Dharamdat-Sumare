> My story began as a humble intern at Savannah-La-Mar Public General Hospital, then I was quickly introduced to public health services at Savannah-La-Mar Health Center, Darlington Health Center, Grange Hill Health Center, White House Health Center in the early part of my career. I moved to Cornwall Regional Hospital where I spent three years in the accident and emergency department. My skills was recognized by the consultants who pushed me to University Hospital of  the West Indies where I worked in the emergency department. I quickly realized I need more experience in public health and move to St. James Public Health Services where I was a senior physician and worked in all the health district in St. James : Type V , Catherine Hall, Adelphi, Maroon Town, Garlands, Salt Spring, Mt. Carey, Cambridge, Catadupa, Roehampton, and Green Pond health centers. I then was hired by Baywest Wellness Hospital and Clinic as a Manager. During my breaks, I worked with Omega Health Services where I was placed in Ochi Rios. In Ochi Rios, I gain experience treating foreigners in five hotels.  I honestly can say that I have seen and treated over 120,000 patients and treated some of the rarest disease that affect us human.  During my time gain experience in medicine, I also am a father one and a loving husband because family is the second to my health. I believe as long as I have my health I will also be okay. I am without any chronic illness and can work under extreme pressure and make decisions alone and with team. I love working with team.
